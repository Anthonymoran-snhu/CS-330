How do I approach designing software?

When designing software, I start by identifying the goals of the project and the requirements needed to meet those goals. I break the problem into smaller, manageable components and plan how each piece interacts within the larger system. Sketches, diagrams, and pseudocode are tools I use to visualize the structure before implementing it. For this project, I considered both the visual composition of the scene and the technical structure, such as object transformations, textures, and lighting.

What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?

Through this project, I strengthened my skills in spatial reasoning and scene layout. I learned to plan object placement with accurate scaling and proportions, and I became more comfortable thinking in 3D space. I also improved my ability to make design trade-offs, such as simplifying textures while maintaining visual clarity.

What design process did you follow for your project work?

I followed an iterative design process. First, I sketched the scene layout and measured the real-world objects I wanted to recreate. Then I built a basic 3D model with placeholder objects. Next, I refined shapes, applied textures, and adjusted lighting to improve realism. At each step, I tested the scene in the viewport and made adjustments based on visual feedback.

How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?

Breaking down complex systems into smaller tasks, planning visually, and testing frequently are tactics I can apply to any software or graphics project. This approach encourages organization, efficiency, and flexibility—skills that are valuable in game development, simulations, and user interface design.

How do I approach developing programs?

I approach development systematically: implement core functionality first, test incrementally, and then expand features. I prioritize readability and maintainability, writing modular code that can be adjusted or reused later. For this project, I focused on creating reusable functions for object transformations and material assignments.

What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?

I used a strategy of iterative refinement, where I built the scene in layers: starting with basic shapes, then adding textures, and finally implementing lighting and shadows. I also applied debugging strategies specific to graphics, such as visually inspecting transformations and checking object alignment in the scene.

How did iteration factor into your development?

Iteration was central to my workflow. Every time I adjusted object positions, textures, or lighting, I tested the changes in the viewport and made further refinements. This approach helped me fix issues like floating objects, mismatched scales, and lighting inconsistencies efficiently.

How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the project’s completion?

Throughout the milestones, I learned to break problems into smaller, testable units and focus on one aspect at a time. My debugging became more methodical, and I became more confident in making incremental improvements. This evolution allowed me to complete the project without being overwhelmed by its complexity.

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?

Computer science equips me with problem-solving skills and the ability to create digital tools, simulations, and visualizations. These skills are directly applicable to careers in software development, game design, and computational research.

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?

Working with 3D graphics has improved my spatial reasoning, understanding of linear algebra and geometry, and ability to translate real-world measurements into digital models. These skills will benefit future coursework in computer graphics, simulation, or virtual reality development.

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?

Professionally, these skills can be applied to designing games, simulations, educational software, or interactive visualizations. I now have experience managing complex 3D scenes, implementing textures and lighting, and using iterative design—capabilities that make me a more versatile developer and problem solver.
